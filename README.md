# Software Design Repository Introduction

Welcome to my collection of projects developed using Test Driven Development (TDD) and various software design principles and patterns. This repository showcases my proficiency in creating robust, maintainable, and well-structured software in Python.


## Projects Overview

Each project in this repository demonstrates the use of TDD and incorporates different design patterns and software engineering principles. Here's a brief overview:

1. Game of Life Implementation: Conway's Game of Life simulated using Python with a Pygame interface.

2. Text Manipulation Toolkit: A suite of tools for text formatting, filtering, and transformation.

3. Prime Number Generator: Generates a list of prime numbers and includes an interactive display.

4. ISS Tracking and Information: Fetches and displays real-time information about the ISS and its astronauts.

5. Factorial Calculator Variants: Implements factorial calculation using different programming paradigms.

## Features

- Implementation of various algorithms and functionalities in Python.
- Robust unit testing for each module to ensure code reliability.
- Interactive console-based applications for user engagement.
- Use of external libraries like pygame, requests, geopy, and more for enhanced functionality.
- Exception handling and error reporting for reliability and ease of debugging.

## Getting Started

To get started with these projects, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/arjunrao122/Software-Design]
cd your-repository-name
# install dependencies (if any)
```

## Running the Projects

Each project can be run independently. Navigate to the project's directory and run the Python script:

```bash
cd path/to/project
python script_name.py
```

## Testing

Each project includes comprehensive unit tests, ensuring the functionality meets specified requirements. To run tests, navigate to the respective project directory and execute the test scripts.

## Contributing
