# FactorialCalculatorSuit

## Overview
This project provides various implementations of the factorial function, demonstrating different programming paradigms. It includes a functional iterator method, an imperative iteration method, and a simple recursion method. A common decorator is used across all implementations to validate input values.

## Structure
- `factorial_functional_iterator.py`: Implements factorial using a functional programming approach.
- `factorial_imperative_iteration.py`: Implements factorial using an imperative programming approach.
- `factorial_simple_recursion.py`: Implements factorial using recursion.
- `factorial_check_input_value.py`: Contains a decorator to check input values before calculating factorial.
- `factorial_calculator.py`: A command-line interface to interact with the different factorial implementations.
- `test_factorial.py`: Base test class for common tests across all implementations.
- `test_factorial_iterative.py`: Test suite for the imperative iteration implementation.
- `test_factorial_recursive.py`: Test suite for the recursive implementation.
- `test_functional_iteration.py`: Test suite for the functional iterator implementation.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Usage
To use the factorial calculator, run the `factorial_calculator.py` script:
```bash
python factorial_calculator.py
```

## Testing
To run the tests for all implementations, execute the respective test files:
```bash
python test_factorial_iterative.py
python test_factorial_recursive.py
python test_functional_iteration.py
```
