# Conway's Game of Life - Pygame Edition

## Overview
This project is a Python implementation of Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Horton Conway. It's a zero-player game, meaning its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.

## Features
- Interactive Cell Selection: Users can click on the grid to select the initial alive cells.
- Real-Time Simulation: Watch the cells evolve generation by generation.
- Pause and Resume: Control the simulation with a simple keypress.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pygame

## Installation
To run this project, first clone the repository:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/arjunrao122/Software-Design]
cd PyGameOfLife
```

## Usage
Run the script from the command line:
```bash
python game_of_life_main.py
```

Interact with the game:

- Click on the grid to toggle the state of the cells.
- Press the space bar to start or pause the simulation.
